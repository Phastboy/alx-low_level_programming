# Hello world

- This directory is about different ways to use `gcc` command which working with `C` programming language.
- It also touches the intro on `c`.
- It contains my solution to `ALX` `alx-low_level_programming/0x00-hello_world` task.
- Each file here is either a script or a `c` file.

## Scripts

- `0-preprocessor`: Script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
- `1-compiler`: Script that compiles c code but does not link.
- `2-assembler`: Script that generate the assembly code of a C code.
- `3-name`: Script that compiles a c file to an executable named `cisfun`.
